- Define the bernoulli distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the binomial distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the poisson distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the uniform distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
- Define the normal distribution, and give example of situations it describes.
